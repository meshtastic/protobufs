# FIXME pick a higher number someday? or do dynamic alloc in nanopb?
*DeviceState.node_db max_count:32

# FIXME - max_count is actually 32 but we save/load this as one long string of preencoded MeshPacket bytes - not a big array in RAM
*DeviceState.receive_queue max_count:1

*ChannelFile.channels max_count:8
