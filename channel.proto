 * A note about how channel names are shown to users: channelname-Xy
 * poundsymbol is a prefix used to indicate this is a channel name (idea from @professr).
 * Where X is a letter from A-Z (base 26) representing a hash of the PSK for this
 * channel - so that if the user changes anything about the channel (which does

 * two friends try to type in a channel name of "BobsChan" and then can't talk
 * because their PSKs will be different.
 * The PSK is hashed into this letter by "0x41 + [xor all bytes of the psk ] modulo 26"
 * This also allows the option of someday if people have the PSK off (zero), the
 * users COULD type in a channel name and be able to talk.
 * Y is a lower case letter from a-z that represents the channel 'speed' settings
